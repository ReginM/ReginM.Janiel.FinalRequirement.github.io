          tend to avoid challenges, quickly give up and consider criticism to be personal attacks. "</i></p>

                                <img src="https://images.penguinrandomhouse.com/cover/9780345472328" style="width:100%;max-width:300px;" class="w3-margin-right">

                            <p style="text-align: center;"><i>" In her book Mindset: The New Psychology of Success, psychologist Carol Dweck 
          popularized the concept of the growth mindset. Dweck's study showed that people with growth 
          thinking tend to achieve more in academia, sports, and others areas than people with fixed thinking. 
          People with growth mindsets see challenges as opportunities for learning and growth, not threats 
          to intelligence or abilities. I believe that a growth mindset is key to personal and professional 
          development. When we have a growth mindset, we are more likely to take risks, try new things, 
          and achieve greater success and satisfaction in life. We also tend to persevere through difficulties 
          rather than give up when the first signs of difficulties arise. "</i></p>


                            <img src="https://www.actioncoach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/iStock-663352750.jpg" style="width:100%;max-width:1000px;" class="w3-margin-right">

                            <p style="text-align: center;"><i>" One aspect of a growth mindset that I find especially valuable is the emphasis on learning 
          from failure. Failure, when viewed through the lens of a growth mindset, is viewed as an 
          opportunity to learn and grow rather than a reflection of our abilities or intelligence. This is 
          extremely empowering because it allows us to see setbacks as stepping stones to success rather 
          than obstacles. The emphasis on effort rather than talent is another aspect of a growth mindset that 
          I value. When we have a growth mindset, we understand that hard work and dedication are 
          frequently more important than natural ability. This can be a great equalizer because it means that 
          anyone who is persistent and eager to learn can succeed. "</i></p>

                            <p style="text-align: center;"><i>" Now on my part, a growth mindset can be extremely beneficial as an OJT trainee in the I.T.
          business field. The field of information technology is known for its difficulties and obstacles, and 
          having a growth mindset can help you see these difficulties as opportunities to learn and grow. 
          When you have a growth mindset, you can see feedback and criticism as opportunities to improve 
          rather than as a criticism of your abilities. Persistence is also important in the IT industry, and 
          having a growth mindset can help you persevere and overcome obstacles. A growth mindset can 
          also assist you in approaching new technologies with curiosity and eagerness to learn, rather than 
          fear. Finally, in the information technology industry, collaboration is extremely important, and a 
          growth mindset encourages open communication and a willingness to learn from others. Overall, 
          developing the skills and attitudes required to succeed in the information technology industry can 
          be aided by having a growth mindset "</i></p>

                            <p style="text-align: center;"><i>" Is it that important that I should a growth mindset? Yes, an IT OJT trainee requires a growth 
          mindset. The field of information technology is always evolving, and new technologies are 
          constantly being introduced. As an OJT student in IT, you will face a variety of challenges and 
          opportunities to learn new skills. If you have a growth mindset, you can approach these challenges 
          and opportunities with a positive attitude and willingness to learn. In addition, as an IT OJT trainee, 
          you will almost certainly receive performance feedback from your supervisor or coworkers. A 
          growth mindset can help you see this feedback as an opportunity to learn and grow, rather than a 
          criticism of your abilities. Furthermore, accepting and incorporating feedback into your work can 
          help you learn new skills and become a more effective IT professional. Furthermore, in the IT 
          industry, working in teams is common, and having a growth mindset can help you collaborate 
          effectively with your coworkers. By valuing the perspectives and ideas of others, you can 
          collaborate to solve problems and achieve goals. A growth mindset also encourages open 
          communication and the willingness to learn from others. "</i></p>

                            <p style="text-align: center;"><i>" Additionally, the growth mindset does not only exists in the I.T. field, it also exists in other 
            areas, for example, in other businesses or fields that exist in this era. In this modern generation and 
            today's world, a growth mindset can be a powerful tool for success and personal growth. This 
            school of thought believes that rather than being fixed characteristics, intelligence, and ability can 
            be developed through hard work and dedication. It motivates people to try new things, persevere 
            in the face of adversity, and look for new learning opportunities. "</i></p>

                            <p style="text-align: center;"><i>" Increased resilience is one of the advantages of a growth mindset. Resilience is essential in 
              today's rapidly changing world for adapting to new situations and recovering from setbacks. 
              Failures and setbacks are viewed as opportunities to learn and grow by those with a growth 
              mindset, rather than as indicators of their limitations. They are also more likely to persevere and 
              remain motivated in the face of adversity. Another advantage of having a growth mindset is 
              improved learning. Instead of avoiding challenges, this mindset encourages people to seek out new 
              learning opportunities and embrace them. Those with a growth mindset can learn new skills and 
              knowledge by valuing effort and dedication, even in areas where they previously struggled. "</i></p>

                            <p style="text-align: center;"><i>" A growth mindset can also promote creativity and innovation. Because they value new 
                ideas and perspectives, those with a growth mindset can approach problems from various 
                perspectives and develop novel solutions. This is particularly useful in fields where innovation is 
                essential, such as technology, entrepreneurship, or the arts. Finally, a growth mindset can assist 
                individuals in achieving greater success and personal growth outside of their professional careers. 
                Individuals who embrace challenges, persevere in the face of adversity, and value learning and 
                collaboration are more likely to achieve their objectives and realize their full potential. Individuals 
                who have a growth mindset can help others develop the resilience, creativity, and collaborative 
                skills needed for success in today's world, whether in personal or professional endeavors "</i></p>

                        <p class="w3-text-grey" style="text-align: center;">Hi, my name is Brynna Janiel L. Potenciano and I am currently 21 years old. I was born in New Bataan on August 21, 2001. Growing up, I developed a keen interest in various hobbies, particularly sports such as badminton, volleyball,
                            and dancing. In addition to these outdoor activities, I also enjoy reading novels and drawing as my indoor hobbies.</p><br>

                        <h5 style="text-align: center;">Skills and Expertise</h5>
                        <p class="w3-text-grey" style="text-align: center;">As a skilled multimedia video editor and encoder, I possess a wealth of technical knowledge and expertise that I've developed through years of hands-on experience. In terms of video editing, I am proficient in using industry-standard
                            software like Adobe Premiere Pro and Final Cut Pro. I have a keen eye for detail and a passion for storytelling, which enables me to create videos that are not only visually stunning but also engaging and informative. Whether
                            it's a corporate promotional video, a short film, or a music video, I can bring your vision to life. </p><br>
                        <p class="w3-text-grey" style="text-align: center;">When it comes to encoding data, I am a quick and accurate typist with excellent attention to detail. I understand the importance of accurate data entry, and I take pride in ensuring that every piece of data I encode is correct
                            and up-to-date. Whether it's entering customer information, financial records, or inventory data, I am meticulous in my approach and never compromise on accuracy. </p><br>
